# touch_detection_with_accelerometer-array
Prosjekt oppgave med SINTEF og NTNU
## Project Description
This project will focus on using beyond-state-of-the-art accelerometers to make surfaces touch-enabled. 
SINTEF is developing optical MEMS accelerometers with noise characteristics sufficiently good to detect finger vibrations in tables/floors/walls. 
They can be embedded in a portable "puck" that can be placed on a surface as needed to make it touch-sensitive.
## Project report
The work in this repository is based on the project description above, but as the MEMS were not finished in time we had to use other sensors. 
The code in the repo is developed to do research on the topic, and we had to learn the behaviour of acoustic waves in the plate during the research. 
## Running the project
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```
To create the figures from the report run 

``` python main.py ```

### Notes
The code is still very messy as we developed as we learn the theory.
