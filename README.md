# touch_detection_with_accelerometer-array
Specialization project with SINTEF and NTNU.

## Project Description
This project will focus on using beyond-state-of-the-art accelerometers to make surfaces touch-enabled. 
SINTEF is developing optical MEMS accelerometers with noise characteristics sufficiently good to detect finger vibrations in tables/floors/walls. 
They can be embedded in a portable "puck" that can be placed on a surface as needed to make it touch-sensitive.

## Code
The code for the different project can be found in branch "vegard_project" and "niklas". Both branches is based on the same repo.
