## 1.1.0 - 2023-01-18
Trying to make use of the correlation technique described by Ziola and Gorman in "Source location in thin plates using cross-correlation". The results did not yield any great results. Somewhat similar to using regular bandpassing, but I suspect it is limited by the triangular shape of pulse compression. Could however keep testing different frequencies and standard deviations for the gaussian pulse.

## 1.0.0 - 2023-01-09
Final changes before exporting to a different repository for delivering the project.
